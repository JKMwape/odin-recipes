Hey there, I wasn't too this was supposed to be done on github or on my PC 
but I am doing it on my PC, might be late for work but meh its okay, it'll 
be a good day today :D. So today I will building a basic recipe website and 
yeah that's it, there will be an index page that will link to a couple of 
other pages and yeah it'll be good.
